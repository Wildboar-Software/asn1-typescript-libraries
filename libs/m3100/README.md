# M.3100 in TypeScript

TypeScript implementation of the ASN.1 data structures and PDUs defined in the
M.3100 series of recommendations published by the
[International Telecommunication Union's (ITU)](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).
