# Signed Public Key and Challenge (SPKAC) in TypeScript

ASN.1 data structures based on the ASN.1 definitions in
[a draft IETF RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-leggett-spkac),
which defines the Signed Public Key and Challenge (SPKAC).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).
