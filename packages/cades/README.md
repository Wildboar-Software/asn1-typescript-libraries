# CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES) in TypeScript

TypeScript implementation of the ASN.1 data structures defined in the
[European Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI)](https://www.etsi.org/)
publication
[ETSI TS 101 733 V2.2.1 (2013-04)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101700_101799/101733/02.02.01_60/ts_101733v020201p.pdf).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
