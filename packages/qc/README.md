# Qualified Certificates in TypeScript

ASN.1 data structures based on the ASN.1 definitions in
[IETF RFC 3739](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3739), which defines
the Qualified Certificates (QC) profile for X.509 public-key certificates.

See the
[documentation](https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/asn1-typescript-libraries/blob/master/docs/all.md)
that applies to this library and others to learn how to use this module.

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).

## ESM-Only

As of June 12th, 2025, this module is only compiled to ESM. CommonJS will no
longer be supported.
