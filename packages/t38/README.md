# T.38 Fax-over-IP (FoIP) PDUs in TypeScript

The PDUs and other data types from the ASN.1 definitions defined in the
[International Telecommunication Union's (ITU)](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx)
Recommendation T.38, which defines a protocol for relaying Fax data over
Internetworking Protocol (IP).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
