# Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework in TypeScript

TypeScript equivalent of ASN.1 data structures derived from
[ISO/IEC 19785-1:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/77892.html), which defines
Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework.

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
