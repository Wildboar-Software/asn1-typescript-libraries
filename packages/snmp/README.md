# SNMP ASN.1 Data Structures in TypeScript

The PDUs and other data types from the ASN.1 definitions defined in
[IETF RFC 3412](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3412) and
[IETF RFC 3416](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3416) for the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).
