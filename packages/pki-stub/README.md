# X.500 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Stub in TypeScript

TypeScript implementation of the ASN.1 data structures and PDUs defined in the
PKI-Stub ASN.1 Module defined by the
[International Telecommunication Union's (ITU)](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx)
[recommendation X.510](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.510/en).

See the
[documentation](https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/asn1-typescript-libraries/blob/master/docs/all.md)
that applies to this library and others to learn how to use this module.

This library only implements the ASN.1 data structures and PDUs defined in these
specifications.

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in TypeScript or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).

## ESM-Only

As of June 12th, 2025, this module is only compiled to ESM. CommonJS will no
longer be supported.
